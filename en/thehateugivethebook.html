            ”However, I believe that one day that will change. How ? I don't know. When ? I know even less. So why ? Because there will always be someone to fight for. And maybe now it's my turn.
            Others are fighting too, even in Garden Heights where we sometimes have the impression that there is not much to defend. People realize, shout, demonstrate, demand. They don't forget. I think that's the most important thing.
            Khalil, I will never forget him.
            I'll never give up.
            I will never shut up.
            I promise."

              Angie THOMAS found the inspiration for this novel in 2010, just after the case of Oscar Grant, a young man shot dead by the police.

              Tupac is an important figure in the book, the title “the hate u give” comes from the famous tattoo he had on his stomach “THUGLIFE” which means “The hate you to the little infants fucks everybody”, “the hatred that we give the children fuck the world up”

            <p class="title__p">Identifying Starr and Seven's characters as roses that grew in harsh environments is a powerful metaphor that reflects their resilience and ability to thrive despite the adverse conditions around them. “Roses can grow in harsh environments and still bloom,” this metaphor was inspired by Tupac Shakur’s poem “The Rose That Grew From Concrete”
